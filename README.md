**TIME BASED GREETING MESSAGE**
-----
*Description*: _This is a simple project which will greet you based on the time of day and tell you the date as well. It will work based on the time and date of your
system._
*Objective*: Display greetings in a pop-up message box, similar to JavaScript alerts. Since Python lacks a built-in alert function, research alternatives using AI tools 
or search engines.
*Explanation*: I made a programme where i used the time, random, and pymsgbox modules. I extracted the current time and date. I then converted the month number to its name
and then used an if elif method to display a greeting based on the time in the device it is running in. E.g.: good morning for morning and good afternoon for afternoon. To
make it a little more creative I made 3 small dictionary where there were 6 translations each of good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. I made a function and used
a for loop to print any one translation randomly.
